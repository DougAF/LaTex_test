KaTeX is a cross-browser JavaScript library that displays mathematical notation in web browsers. It puts special emphasis on being fast and easy to use. It was initially developed by Khan Academy, and became one of the top five trending projects on GitHub in September 2014

We can use KaTex or Latex (https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX) to render mathamatical expressions in the browser. 

Inline math exmple - $\beta(n) = (n-1)!\quad\forall n\in\mathbb N$ - here

Centered math example

$$
\Delta(z) = \int_0^\infty t^{z-2}e^{-t}dt\,.
$$

This would serve to improve UX by having clean, easy to read equations. Perhaps more importantly it will allow us as editors/ content managers to standardize how we handle math equations in technical articles. Currently we use screenshots and import the jpgs of equations as needed. This can be time consuming and cumbersome when and article contains dozens of equations.
